Among the earliest and most significant figures of the gangsta rap subgenre, the group is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential acts in hip hop music.\nActive from 1987 to 1991, N.W.A endured controversy owing to their music's explicit lyrics, which many viewed as misogynistic or homophobic, as well as to its glorification of drugs and crime. The group was subsequently banned from many mainstream American radio stations. In spite of this, they have sold over ten million units in the United States alone. Drawing on its members' own experiences of racism and excessive policing, N.W.A made inherently political music. N.W.A's consistent criticisms of institutional racism within the American police significantly contributed to the political awareness and involvement of American youth against racism."]}

The group's popular live performances have ranged across multiple elaborate tours over their career.\nThe band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, (1983), and singles \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Pride (In the Name of Love)\" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. Their fourth album, (1984), was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, whose influence resulted in a more abstract, ambient sound for the band.
