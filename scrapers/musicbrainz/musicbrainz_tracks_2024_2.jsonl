Rooted in the New York rap scene and gangsta rap traditions, he is widely considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive, laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting his lyrics' often grim content. His music was usually semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality but also of debauchery and celebration.\nBorn and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Wallace was the first artist to sign with Sean \"Puffy\" Combs's Bad Boy Records in 1993. That same year, he gained recognition for his guest appearances on other artists' singles. His debut studio album, Ready to Die (1994), received widespread critical acclaim and included signature tracks \"Juicy\" and \"Big Poppa\". This album made him the central figure in East Coast hip hop, helping to restore New York's prominence at a time when the West Coast was dominating the genre. In 1995, Wallace was named Rapper of the Year at the Music Awards. That same year, Wallace and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 group, Junior M.A.F.I.A.\u2014which included longtime friends like Lil' Kim\u2014released their debut album, (1995).", "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer.

While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass.\nAfter the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and (2002), became worldwide successes; the latter was the best-selling album worldwide of that year, and remains the best-selling hip-hop album in history. Following the release of (2004), Eminem went on hiatus, largely due to a prescription drug addiction.
