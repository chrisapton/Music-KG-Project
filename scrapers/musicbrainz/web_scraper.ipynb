His breakout project—the collaborative extended play (EP) with record producer Metro Boomin titled <i>Savage Mode</i> (2016)—peaked at number 23 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Its lead singles, \"X\" (featuring Future) and \"No Heart\" both peaked within the top 40 of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Later that year, he saw further recognition for his guest appearance on Drake's single \"Sneakin'\". He then signed a recording contract with Epic Records in January 2017.\n",

That same year, he released the collaborative album <i>Without Warning</i> (2017) with Metro Boomin and fellow Georgia-based rapper Offset, and guest appeared on Post Malone's 2017 single \"Rockstar\", which peaked atop the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and received two nominations—Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance—at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. His second album, <i>I Am &gt; I Was</i> (2018), became his first to debut atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and spawned the single \"A Lot\" (featuring J. Cole), which won Best Rap Song at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. The following year, he and Metro Boomin released a sequel to their breakout EP with <i>Savage Mode II</i> (2020), which also debuted atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and spawned the top ten-singles \"Runnin\" and \"Mr. Right Now\" (featuring Drake). He guest appeared on Drake's 2022 single \"Jimmy Cooks\", which marked his first song to debut atop the Hot 100 and second to do so overall. Later that year, he and Drake released the collaborative album <i>Her Loss</i> (2022), which saw continued success as his third project to peak the <i>Billboard</i> 200.

He was granted bond on February 12 and released the next day, pending the outcome of an expedited deportation hearing, which was initially scheduled for April 9, but was later postponed indefinitely, with 21 Savage's lawyers stating he was legally residing in the U.S. for several years prior to the 2005 H-4 visa. In 2023, 21 Savage became a lawful permanent resident of the United States and received his green card; he is eligible for citizenship in 2028.\n",

      "Wikipedia Summary:  Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph (born October 22, 1992), known professionally as 21 Savage , is an American and British rapper. Born in London and raised in Atlanta, he began his recording career in 2013 and released three independent mixtapes to regional acclaim. His breakout project—the collaborative extended play (EP) with record producer Metro Boomin titled Savage Mode (2016)—peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200. Its lead singles, \"X\" (featuring Future) and \"No Heart\" both peaked within the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Later that year, he saw further recognition for his guest appearance on Drake's single \"Sneakin'\". He then signed a recording contract with Epic Records in January 2017. 21 Savage's debut studio album, Issa Album (2017), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, while its lead single, \"Bank Account\" peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. That same year, he released the collaborative album Without Warning (2017) with Metro Boomin and fellow Georgia-based rapper Offset, and guest appeared on Post Malone's 2017 single \"Rockstar\", which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and received two nominations—Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance—at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. His second album, I Am > I Was (2018), became his first to debut atop the Billboard 200 and spawned the single \"A Lot\" (featuring J. Cole), which won Best Rap Song at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. The following year, he and Metro Boomin released a sequel to their breakout EP with Savage Mode II (2020), which also debuted atop the Billboard 200 and spawned the top ten-singles \"Runnin\" and \"Mr. Right Now\" (featuring Drake). He guest appeared on Drake's 2022 single \"Jimmy Cooks\", which marked his first song to debut atop the Hot 100 and second to do so overall. Later that year, he and Drake released the collaborative album Her Loss (2022), which saw continued success as his third project to peak the Billboard 200. His third album, American Dream (2024), became his fourth consecutive chart-topping project, and spawned the Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs \"Redrum\" and \"Née-Nah\". 21 Savage was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on February 3, 2019. Officials revealed his status as a British citizen who entered the U.S. in July 2005 and unlawfully overstayed an H-4 visa that expired in 2006. He was granted bond on February 12 and released the next day, pending the outcome of an expedited deportation hearing, which was initially scheduled for April 9, but was later postponed indefinitely, with 21 Savage's lawyers stating he was legally residing in the U.S. for several years prior to the 2005 H-4 visa. In 2023, 21 Savage became a lawful permanent resident of the United States and received his green card; he is eligible for citizenship in 2028.\n",

      "Wikipedia Summary:  Keenon Dequan Ray Jackson (born March 9, 1990), better known by his stage name YG (short for Y oung G angsta), is an American rapper. He released his debut mixtape 4Fingaz in 2008, and its follow-up, The Real 4Fingaz , the following year. The latter gained recognition for its local hit song \"Toot It and Boot It\", which entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 67 and received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings in October 2009, which entered joint-venture with Atlanta-based rapper Jeezy's record label, CTE World, in 2013. His 2013 single, \"My Nigga\" (featuring Jeezy and Rich Homie Quan), peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song and its follow-ups, \"Left, Right\" (featuring DJ Mustard) and \"Who Do You Love?\" (featuring Drake), preceded the release of his debut studio album, My Krazy Life (2014), which peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and saw positive critical reception. Also in 2014, he guest appeared on Jeremih's single \"Don't Tell 'Em\", which peaked at number six on the Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song. His second album, Still Brazy (2016), was met with critical acclaim despite less commercial orientation, as it explored political and social issues for its subject matter. His third studio album, Stay Dangerous (2018), was met with continued critical and commercial success. It was preceded by the single \"Big Bank\" (featuring 2 Chainz, Big Sean and Nicki Minaj), which peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains his highest-charting song as a lead artist. His fourth studio album, 4Real 4Real (2019), was released in memory of slain rapper and frequent collaborator Nipsey Hussle. His fifth and sixth studio albums, My Life 4Hunnid (2020) and I Got Issues (2022) followed thereafter. His collaborative albums, Kommunity Service (2021) with Mozzy and Hit Me When U Leave the Klub: The Playlist (2023) with Tyga, were both released independently and met with critical praise.\n",

He is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. Academics regard him as one of the most influential music artists of the 20th century and a prominent political activist for Black America. In addition to his music career, Shakur also wrote poetry and starred in films. He is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide.

Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album <i>2Pacalypse Now</i> in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his conscious rap and political rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial multi-platinum success with his follow-up albums <i>Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...</i> (1993) and <i>Me Against the World</i> (1995). His Diamond certified album <i>All Eyez on Me</i> (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. In addition to his music career, Shakur starred roles in <i>Juice</i> (1992), <i>Poetic Justice</i> (1993), <i>Above the Rim</i> (1994), <i>Bullet</i> (1996), <i>Gridlock'd</i> (1997), and <i>Gang Related</i> (1997). Shakur's most notable songs include \"California Love\", \"Changes\", \"Dear Mama\", \"Hail Mary\", \"Keep Ya Head Up\", \"Hit 'Em Up\", \"Ambitionz az a Ridah\", \"All Eyez on Me\", \"Ghetto Gospel\", \"Do for Love\", \"So Many Tears\", \"To Live &amp; Die in L.A.\", \"How Do U Want It\", \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\", \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" and \"I Get Around\". Alongside his solo career, Shakur was part of the group Thug Life and collaborated with artists like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Outlawz.\n",
      "</p><p>During the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration. He served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending an appeal of his conviction in 1995. Following his release, he signed to Marion \"Suge\" Knight's label Death Row Records and became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip-hop rivalry. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Paradise, Nevada; he died six days later. Following his murder, the Notorious B.I.G. was at first considered a suspect due to their public feud; he was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997, while visiting Los Angeles.

      "Wikipedia Summary: ['Nayvadius DeMun Cash (né Wilburn; born November 20, 1983), known professionally as Future, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record producer. Known for his mumble-styled vocals and prolific output, Future is credited with having pioneered the use of Auto-Tuned melodies in hip-hop and trap music. Due to the sustained popularity of this musical style, he is commonly regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation.\\nBorn and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Future signed a recording contract with Rocko\\'s A1 Recordings in 2011, which entered a joint venture with Epic Records shortly after. His first two studio albums, Pluto (2012) and Honest (2014), were both met with critical and commercial success, spawning the platinum-certified singles \"Turn On the Lights\", \"Honest\", \"Move That Dope\" (featuring Pharrell Williams and Pusha T), and \"I Won\" (featuring Kanye West). His subsequent albums have each debuted atop the US 200; his third and fourth, (2015) and (2016), were supported by the singles \"Where Ya At\" (featuring Drake) and \"Low Life\" (featuring the Weeknd), respectively. Future\\'s eponymous fifth album and its follow-up, (both 2017) made him the first musical act to release two chart-topping projects on the 200 in consecutive weeks—the former spawned his first Hot 100-top ten single, \"Mask Off.\"', 'Leland Tyler Wayne (born September 16, 1993), known professionally as Metro Boomin, is an American record producer and music executive. Widely acclaimed for his dark and cinematic production style, he is regarded as one of the most influential producers in modern hip-hop and trap music. He has produced notable hits for artists such as Future, Post Malone, 21 Savage, Offset, Migos, Kanye West, The Weeknd, Gunna, Gucci Mane, Young Thug, Kodak Black, Drake, and Kendrick Lamar.\\nRaised in St. Louis, Missouri, Wayne began his career in music production in 2009 at the age of 16. He relocated to Atlanta to attend Morehouse College in 2011, during which he worked extensively with Atlanta-based artists including Future, Young Thug, 21 Savage, Gucci Mane, and Migos. Wayne gained wider recognition for co-producing the 2014 single \"Tuesday\" for iLoveMakonnen, which peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100. He was credited on a string of similarly successful singles throughout 2016, including \"Jumpman\" by Drake and Future, \"Father Stretch My Hands\" by Kanye West, \"Low Life\" by Future, and his first number-one production, \"Bad and Boujee\" by Migos. This was followed by the diamond-certified (14x platinum) \"Congratulations\" by Post Malone, \"Tunnel Vision\" by Kodak Black, \"Mask Off\" by Future, \"Bank Account\" by 21 Savage, and his second number-one production, \"Heartless\" by the Weeknd.', 'Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper. Regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, he was awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music, becoming the first musician outside of the classical and jazz genres to receive the honor.\\nBorn in Compton, California, Lamar began releasing music under the stage name K.Dot while attending high school. He signed with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005, and co-founded the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy there. Following the 2011 release of his alternative rap debut album Section.80, Lamar secured a joint contract with Dr. Dre\\'s Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. He rose to prominence with his gangsta rap-influenced second album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), which became the longest-charting hip hop studio album in Billboard 200 history; named it the greatest concept album of all time. In 2015, Lamar scored his first Hot 100 number-one single, after featuring on the remix of Taylor Swift\\'s \"Bad Blood\", and released his third album, , which infused hip-hop with historical African-American music genres such as jazz, funk, and soul, and became his first of six consecutive number-one albums on the Billboard 200 chart.']\n",
